Gnome 3 application settings GUI editor

Problematic area: some hotkeys are not changable through GUI in mu lovely ubuntu-gnome-desktop, like &lt;Alt&gt;+F1.

Solution: you want to disable key combination &lt;Alt&gt;+F1 in Gnome for comfortable work in jetBrains IDE, so you open the app, open search tab, search for '&lt;Alt&gt;F1', double click on desired value, change it to '[]' or whatever you want and press 'Save'. That's it.
